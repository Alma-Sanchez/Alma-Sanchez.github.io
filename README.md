# About Me

My name is Alma, I'm a first generation college graduate with a BS in Computer Science from American University. I love working with JavaScript and learning more about UI/UX in order to provide a pleasant experience when creating websites.

Some of my hobbies include calligraphy, drawing, exploring new music and watching organization/lifestyle videos on youtube.
